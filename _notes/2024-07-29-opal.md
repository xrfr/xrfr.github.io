# Introduction

Opal is a new way to look at computation.
With it, you can present your ideas, code, and data in a natural way.

# Features

Each document is organized into blocks.
Blocks can be markdown, text, javascript, or python.

Code blocks are reactive, so as soon as you update your code, all dependent blocks will
automatically be run.

Collaborate with other people in real time.

# Implementation

## Frontend

It takes the form of a web app.
We can make a desktop app wrapper around it using [wails](https://wails.io/).

Components
- text/code editor
- file browser
- rich views of a file
    - code notebook
    - rendered web page

- We can use [sandpack](sandpack) for some of these components
    - Sandpack gives you a code editor in the browser
    - Nodebox allows you to run a modified version of node in the browser, so
      most of the lifting can be done on the client

- For the code notebooks, we can use [Observable](https://observablehq.com/framework/)
    - this is a reactive code notebook with a lot of cool features

## Backend

We use golang and `pocketbase`

# Updates

## Getting Sandpack working

Let's start by building a basic text editor in the browser.
From there we can start to add other features.

We start from one of the starter projects provided by sandpack, downloaded here.
This one shows how to use the Monaco code editor instead of the default one
provided by Sandpack (CodeMirror).

Off to a bad start, it seems like there are some dependency issues between react
and typescript?

We can try upgrading them to the latest versions and see if that works.
Upgrading all the dependencies to the lastest version worked.

We remove `customStyle` since that appears to not exist anymore.
We find that `activePath` has been renamed to `activeFile`.
After that a few other fixes, we are able to finally run the starter project.

Sandbox gives us starter templates for common frameworks.

Let's try out the CodeMirror editor.
Actually we can see this code, but it doesn't render inside `browsh`. See screenshot instead.

Cool, we can run node inside the browser!

## Running Observable in the browser

Running Observable directly in the browser seems possible, but so far it's been presenting some
issues.

# TODO

- [ ] Running Observable on the backend
- [ ] Connecting to a virtual filesystem
- [ ] Connecting to local filesystem
